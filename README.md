# Quaero
*"quaero" - Latin verb meaning "I seek", "I am looking"*  

Initially designed with a Cirque trackpad in mind, this idea was unfortunately dropped due to budget changes.
This was initially made for ![Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com), finished and submitted for ![Grounded](https://grounded.hackclub.com), and properly polished and physically finished for ![Reboot](https://reboot.hackclub.com).
